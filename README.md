# Projects Folder

## Introduction
My name is Gerrick Sands, a CyberSecurity engineer with a focus in automation. This repository is to be my working portfolio for active projects. Feel free to use what you find useful.

## Automation Projects
This will be more of an infrastructure automation folder. The idea is to automate vm's via Ansible, Terraform, GitLab, AWS, etc.

## Programming Projects
This folder is where my scripts for automated certain functions will live. The languages will be PowerShell, Bash, Python, etc.
