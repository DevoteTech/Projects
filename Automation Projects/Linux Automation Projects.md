# Linux Automation Projects

## 1. Automated Patch Management and Security Updates

### **Problem:**  
Managing security updates and patches across a large fleet of Linux servers can be challenging. Without automation, it increases the risk of human error, delayed patches, and potential security vulnerabilities due to outdated software.

### **Solution:**  
- **Automation Goal:** Implement an automated solution to handle patch management, update verification, and reboot scheduling.  
- **Tools:** Ansible, Bash scripts, Cron jobs, Puppet, Chef.

### **Key Steps:**  
1. **Inventory Management:** Use Ansible to dynamically inventory servers.  
2. **Patch Installation:** Automate the installation of security patches with `yum`, `dnf`, or `apt` depending on the distro.  
3. **Compliance Checks:** Create scripts to verify if critical patches have been applied.  
4. **Reboot Scheduling:** Automate reboots after updates, with logic to avoid downtime during peak hours.  
5. **Reporting:** Generate automated patch reports to confirm patch compliance and identify servers that missed updates.

## 2. Centralized Log Rotation and Archival

### **Problem:**  
Inconsistent or inefficient log rotation across servers can lead to disk space exhaustion and difficulty in analyzing logs. Manually rotating logs on large infrastructures is error-prone and doesn't scale well.

### **Solution:**  
- **Automation Goal:** Implement a standardized, automated log rotation, compression, and archival process across all Linux servers.  
- **Tools:** Logrotate, Cron jobs, Bash or Python scripts, ELK Stack, Graylog.

### **Key Steps:**  
1. **Configuration Standardization:** Deploy consistent `logrotate` configurations to ensure logs are rotated based on size, time, or both.  
2. **Compression & Archival:** Automate log compression to save disk space and move old logs to archival storage.  
3. **Monitoring Disk Space:** Create a script to monitor disk usage and alert when thresholds are exceeded.  
4. **Log Forwarding:** Implement log forwarding to a centralized log server for long-term storage and analysis.  
5. **Error Handling:** Automate the handling of rotation failures or permission errors and generate alerts when issues arise.

## 3. Automated System Provisioning and Configuration

### **Problem:**  
Manually provisioning and configuring Linux systems is time-consuming and inconsistent, especially when scaling infrastructure. This increases deployment times and introduces configuration drift.

### **Solution:**  
- **Automation Goal:** Automate the provisioning, configuration, and deployment of Linux servers to ensure consistency and reduce human error.  
- **Tools:** Ansible, Terraform, Kickstart (for Red Hat-based systems), Preseed (for Debian-based systems), Cloud-Init.

### **Key Steps:**  
1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Use Terraform to automate the creation of cloud or on-premises servers.  
2. **Configuration Management:** Apply consistent configurations with Ansible playbooks or Puppet manifests.  
3. **Bootstrapping:** Use Kickstart or Preseed files to automate OS installations and initial configurations.  
4. **Cloud Initialization:** Implement Cloud-Init for cloud-based server initialization.  
5. **Testing and Validation:** Automate tests with tools like Testinfra or Serverspec to validate system configurations post-deployment.

## 4. Automated Backup and Recovery Solution

### **Problem:**  
Manual backup processes are prone to inconsistency and data loss. In case of system failures or disasters, recovering critical data can be time-consuming without an automated solution.

### **Solution:**  
- **Automation Goal:** Implement a reliable, automated backup and recovery process to protect critical data and ensure quick recovery.  
- **Tools:** `rsync`, `tar`, `cron`, `borgbackup`, Bacula, Restic, or cloud services like AWS S3 and Glacier.

### **Key Steps:**  
1. **Scheduled Backups:** Use `cron` to schedule regular backups of important files and databases.  
2. **Incremental and Full Backups:** Automate incremental backups to optimize storage and full backups for periodic snapshots.  
3. **Offsite Storage:** Automatically sync backups to offsite locations or cloud storage for redundancy.  
4. **Encryption:** Encrypt backups to ensure data security.  
5. **Automated Recovery Testing:** Regularly test recovery scripts to ensure backups can be restored successfully in case of a failure.
